"""# Summary:
Loans with partial recovery typically have up to 4 missed payments. Fully recovered loans tend to have fewer missed payments, mostly between 0 and 2. Written-off loans show a higher range of missed payments, with several exceeding 6. A higher number of missed payments significantly reduces the likelihood of full recovery and increases the chances of loans being written off.
